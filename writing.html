                <h2>The Onchain Collectorship</h2>
                <p>For visual art to upgrade from hobby to industry an ‘onchain collectorship’ is vital.</p>
                <h3>How things currently play out</h3>
                <p>Art is seen as a luxury, but not in the way that sports, film, tv, and gossip news are. The latter are ingrained in the consumption flywheel of modern civilization. Revenue splits are something I wish to discuss at a later date, but for now they do a markedly better job at monetizing themselves.
                    Art, from the majority, is:
                <ul>
                  <li>rarely paid for (right click save as)</li>
                  <li>haggled down if paid for</li>
                  <li>assumed to be free (reference paywall content discussions on YT)</li>
                  <li>preferred to be stock when designing and decorating public & private spaces</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
                <h3>Why?</h3>
                <p>Regardless of intention, the organization (or lack thereof) of visual art does it no favors. In the offchain era, an artist sold their work physically with loose ownership or authenticity standards. The sales were mostly one-offs or arrangement deals with auction houses and galleries that maximized their leverage in price negotiations.

                <p>This set up only became slightly more negotiable with the advent of social media. An artist now had a hosted platform from which they could broadcast signal and develop a market facing brand. Still, the aforementioned circumstances are still applicable; the domino effect of this tenured chaos bringing about the desert I articulated in <strong>How things currently play out.</strong> </p>

                <p>It is only now, the onchain era, for which we are at the very beginning of, that visual art has a chance to enter a more negotiable space for the value that it supplies.</p>

                <p>Here is a wonderful write up on the intricacies of that oncoming era:</p></p>
              <a href="https://zine.zora.co/onchain-era-yancey-strickler" target="_blank" class="external-link">ONCHAIN ERA</a>
                <h3>Bottlenecks</h3>
                <p>Digging into the meal a little bit further, I would like to list some of the bottlenecks I have found rather prevalent in the visual art community after nearly a decade making art. I believe these to be significant in manifesting the current commercial circumstances we look to overturn in the onchain era.</p>
                <p>
                    These bottlenecks include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Warholism</li>
                        <li>A friend of a friend</li>
                        <li>Style over substance</li>
                        <li>I could've done that</li>
                        <li>Where's the utility?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Warholism</h3>
                <p>I’m not sure if the term has already been coined, but I will define it this way…</p>
                <p>the market preference for tongue in cheek absurdity as a means for status elevation & condescending social commentary by the buyer</p>
                <p>The gist of this is that you will see a preference for buying work that is so absurd (not in style, but in price, person, & effort) that it is the buyer making a statement about themself and how they feel about others.</p>
                <p>As a fan of Warhol I hope this term is not misunderstood for a dig at him, rather a critique on the people who feel self righteous in their support of disingenuous <strong>Warholic</strong> contemporaries. There is a taste conversation to be had here at a later date as well.</p>
                <h3>A friend of a friend</h3>
                <p>People struggle to pinpoint their own taste preferences and heavily rely on their inner circle to help define it. This makes it incredibly challenging for anything outside of their aggregate profile settings to enter it, even if a member of that circle has genuine interest in something outside of it. The inverse of this effect is how ‘hype’ stirs.</p>
                <h3>Style over substance</h3>
                <p>The narrative is starting to shift, but there is a massively unspoken agreement that ‘generalists’ are subpar to the ‘specialists’. There are many preconceived notions about effort and skill development timelines influencing how supporters value art and thereby the artists producing it.</p>
                <p>Small anecdote I think of often:</p>
                <p>Bruce Lee said he fears the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times over the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks one time. In this example I agree, but my counter anecdote to illustrate more context would be - I fear the man who has practiced five kicks 2,000 times each over the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.</p>
                <p>The majority of art supporters do not view it this way. In my opinion, this is one of the greatest bottlenecks onchain collectorship can solve (more on that later).</p>
                <h3>I could've done that</h3>
                <p>Self explanatory.</p>
                <h3>Where's the utility?</h3>
                <p>After being in the nft space for over two years I am just piecing together the deeper connections of <strong>where’s the utility?</strong> question. To me, it is an articulation of long held opinions on art in general. People are now able to pair it with something substantial without it coming across as rude.</p>
                <p>People don’t question the utility of sports, film, tv, books, music, etc. They understand the value proposition. For some reason or another they seem to not consider visual art as being in that wheelhouse - even though it is.</p>
                <p>I believe the onchain ledger will do wonders at mitigating this critique. In the same way that jerseys and flags congregate supporters, so too will the blockchain ledger for collectors I’d wager.</p>
                <h2>How onchain collectorship solves some of this</h2>
                <img src="Images/blog1.png" alt="onchain collectorship">
                <p>To keep this write up within a moderate range I will tackle each of the <strong>Bottlenecks</strong> subheadings through the lens of onchain collectorship (see graphic above).</p>
                <p>These solutions are simply estimated best case scenarios from a couple years of daily research and experimentation. As a creator and collector my goal here is to simply, enhance, and distribute ranges of organization to visual art - so that we can begin to tap into the dormant value propositions.</p>
                <h3>Warholism</h3>
                <p>Time becomes a valuable asset in the discography of a visual artist with blockchains. If we work off the assumption that much of Warholism, as I have previously defined, is the optimal status and wealth creation play within time restricted horizons - then my claim about time becomes valid.</p>
                <p>Quickly let’s add more context to ‘optimal status and wealth creation play within time restricted horizons’.</p>
                <p>As Naval Ravikant so eloquently articulated:</p>
                <p>There are wealth games and status games. The people attacking wealth players are status players.</p>
                <p>Beyond the generalizations of that quote, we understand that it’s truly a mix of both that we are playing. And when discussing visual art it is incredibly grey.</p>
                <p>So, picking a middle curve (non-pejorative) collector, we can estimate that Warholism is a play that brings upon desired results for these collectors; wealth and status. And my claim about ‘optimal status and wealth creation play’ becomes complete when we add in the ‘time horizons’ component.</p>
                <p>Currently we are discussing offchain art. In that space, the time horizon is limited to how long one person tells another person that tells another person. It is limited to the confines of one physical location as well (important to imagine the amount of time other eyes will actually view it and then talk about it). Thus, my definition of Warholism being about absurd commentary hopefully makes more sense now. If you wish to make a statement in a shorter time frame, you must be ‘louder’ (absurd).</p>
                <p>Offchain collectorship I believe weights itself toward Warholism in large part because of this time restricted horizon by which the players have to generate wealth and status.</p>
                <p>Onchain collectorship is an entirely different beast. It does not erase Warholism either. In fact, it provides more time to play the ‘games’. Here we have an upgrade that doesn’t ostracize grandfathered players while simultaneously creating space for other types of players to enter.</p>
                <p>At this point of context it is best to leave you with questions instead of more opinions. So think:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Would you collect more, differently, less, or coherently with 30-100x more time?</li>
                        <li>Would you be as worried about ROI if you had 30-100x more time?</li>
                        <li>Would you take more collector risks with 30-100x more time?</li>
                        <li>Would you experiment with what it means to collect with 30-100x more time?</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>A friend of a friend</h3>
                <p>This one is incredibly simple in my opinion. The global nature of blockchains and the onchain visual art community affords far more ‘hype' generators. No longer confined to your physical locale’s taste preferences, onchain collectors have an entire ocean of avid enjoyers to discuss, share, trade, and build with.</p>
                <p>Offchain art pales in comparison in this aspect. I would even go so far as to say what was a ‘negative’ in offchain art now becomes a ‘positive’ in onchain art.</p>
                <h3>Style over substance</h3>
                <p>The graphic above does a better job articulating this solution. Reminder, offchain art collectors, auction houses, and galleries are playing on shortened time horizons. This means expectations are more rigid.</p>
                <p>In that world having one style is the preference. In onchain collectorship there are endless (as long as we make more humans) suitors. This means that creators can now fully maximize their curiosities, allowing them to resonate with circles that appreciate them, without being penalized by the circles that prefer their initial style.</p>
                <p>As a creator this is one of the more exciting upgrades. I believe we will see a renaissance of creators over the next 10-20 years supercharged by this decentralized taste expression.</p>
                <h3>I could've done that</h3>
                <p>Anyone can mint. Anyone can put their money where their mouth is. And any collector can come by and choose to support them.</p>
                <h3>Where's the utility?</h3>
                <p>I’m going to save this one for a full post later this year. But the short of it is the statement “art is the utility” is onto something. I believe more nuance and unpacking is needed to explain why that is, but time horizons and style expansion have a part to play if you wish to get a jump on unpacking it.</p>
                <h2>Wrap up</h2>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>offchain visual art is highly disorganized</li>
                        <li>onchain visual art births the onchain collectorship</li>
                        <li>offchain collectorship works against the artist because of time horizons</li>
                        <li>onchain collectorship works with the artist because of time horizons</li>
                        <li>bottlenecks of offchain art can be remedied onchain</li>
                        <li>wealth and status games are integral to the art world</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>

                <h2>60 Days Later; What I Learned From Making an Onchain Visual Art Album</h2>
                <p>This project was very much approached like a musical album. You’ve heard about ‘album mode’ from hip hop artists, and if you watch their interviews you’ll see recurring themes in their conversations during that time. The talking points often coincide with personal things the artist is processing.</p>
                <p>HYPERSPEEED was my first attempt at a cohesive project in terms of being vulnerable about my life, presenting it within a thematic visual range, and enriching the context with all at my disposal.</p>
                <h3>The Background</h3>
                <p>“Trying to live life at, HYPERSPEEED” is the slogan of this project. At first I believed it to signify the ability to live life ‘consciously’ and at ‘frequency’ unparalleled to subaverage life standards. Through the creation of the album I came to realize even more.</p>
                <p>As someone who has spent 20+ years traveling the world - raised in a blue-collar broken home, that worked its tail off to ascend socioeconomic hierarchies - I’ve been fortunate enough to experience a wide range of worldly experiences.</p>
                <p>In that blessing are the obstacles that we all face, heartbreak, anxiety, depression, death of loved ones, failure, humiliation, loneliness, etc; as well as some traumatic instances no person should be subject to. Those obstacles led me to a desire for self sovereignty… ie. a life lived at ‘hyperspeeed’.</p>
                <p>I was obsessed with the idea of ‘enlightenment’ the moment I came across it. It sounded like freedom in concept form. Having no issue with detaching from things, I left everything to pursue this conceptual freedom in 2014. From 2015 until 2020 I traveled to four continents, multiple third world countries, and a fair share of the ‘blue chip’ cities like Paris, Tokyo, London, etc.</p>
                <p>In this education of worldly affairs the only other thing I focused on was ‘consciousness’ (think philosophy, religion, science, spirituality, psychology, etc).</p>
                <p>I began to notice patterns in the various substrates of socioeconomic hierarchies. I would see organizations, attitudes, ways of expression, architecture, conflict resolution, technology usage, and even public waste management amongst the corresponding strata. It changed my perspective on the malleable nature of a human, and thus the careless errors & repressed trauma I was weighing myself down with.</p>
                <p>When COVID hit I became unemployed and moved in with family for the time being. It was a blessing in disguise, as it provided a ‘training ground’ to field test the personal philosophy I had been honing throughout the previous 5 years.</p>
                <p>Two years of trial and error later, plus the discovery of blockchain tech and the broader non-fungible internet, I had a more grounded discipline in what it meant to optimize the various life lessons I picked up on the road.</p>
                <p>Moving to the beaches of South Florida at the start of 2022 marked a new chapter in my life; one which would be solely dedicated to my creative career after a successful bull run in 2021.</p>
                <p>Ironically enough, a bear market filling the calendar year was not in my plans, and I was presented another opportunity to field test my personal philosophy. Here we have the groundwork for HYPERSPEEED as an art project.</p>
                <h3>The Art</h3>
                <p>Some of the core themes I’ve picked up from the album in hindsight
                    <ul>
                        <li>Death</li>
                        <li>Beauty</li>
                        <li>Pain</li>
                        <li>Vision</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>A tight rope is a good analogy for ‘enlightenment’ in my opinion. I have experienced times where it truly felt like I was hand in hand with the universe, crafting moments to my liking as they came. This is when it felt like the rope was glued to my feet when I needed balance and unobtrusive when time to walk forward.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, I have experienced times where it felt more like getting knocked out of the sky, falling into a giant pit, and burning in that pit for what felt like eternity.</p>
                <p>Then there are times when it felt like both experiences were happening at the same time. This has happened more than I could ever imagine and is quite challenging to process emotional & intellectually. Thank god for art.</p>
                <p>In this analogy, walking on the tight rope would be enlightenment (or living life at hyperspeeed), while falling off of it would represent living life in some sort of unconscious momentum. You are ‘awake’ in both instances, and both could not exist without the other. Yet one feels better.</p>
                <p>The individual art works in this album are a colorful conversation about my time on the tight rope, pursuing a hyperspeeed lifestyle. Collectively, the album is a philosophy of sorts.</p>
                <p>Pieces like <a href="https://gallery.manifold.xyz/0xa1c6f7c4cddecaed2f62164a36e1b32b9e5e5984/22" target="_blank">I Made Sacrifices</a> warm you with a sun like intimacy, massaging the eyes with an optimistic feeling of triumph after you’ve ‘crossed the valley’. While pieces like <a href="https://gallery.manifold.xyz/0xa1c6f7c4cddecaed2f62164a36e1b32b9e5e5984/35" target="_blank">Ego Death</a> pose more questions than answers.</p>
                <p>The title piece <a href="https://gallery.manifold.xyz/0xa1c6f7c4cddecaed2f62164a36e1b32b9e5e5984/13" target="_blank">Hyperspeeed</a> is a representation of the enlightenment tight rope I mentioned earlier, but brings more context to the intensity of my endeavor. Imagine balancing yourself at the speed of light, while traversing a never-ending tight rope through infinity.</p>
                <p>On the surface, I am incredibly pleased with the aesthetics of this body of work. Beneath the look of each piece, there is a story about some of the highest and lowest points in that arc of my life.</p>
                <p>Pieces like <a href="https://gallery.manifold.xyz/0xa1c6f7c4cddecaed2f62164a36e1b32b9e5e5984/29" target="_blank">Hellraiser</a>, <a href="https://gallery.manifold.xyz/0xa1c6f7c4cddecaed2f62164a36e1b32b9e5e5984/16" target="_blank">Aura Leak</a>, and <a href="https://gallery.manifold.xyz/0xa1c6f7c4cddecaed2f62164a36e1b32b9e5e5984/27" target="_blank">War Torn</a> came from moments in my life that felt inescapable. While pieces like <a href="https://gallery.manifold.xyz/0xa1c6f7c4cddecaed2f62164a36e1b32b9e5e5984/33" target="_blank">Fading Away</a>, <a href="https://gallery.manifold.xyz/0xa1c6f7c4cddecaed2f62164a36e1b32b9e5e5984/26" target="_blank">Fear</a>, <a href="https://gallery.manifold.xyz/0xa1c6f7c4cddecaed2f62164a36e1b32b9e5e5984/28" target="_blank">Belief</a>, <a href="https://gallery.manifold.xyz/0xa1c6f7c4cddecaed2f62164a36e1b32b9e5e5984/32" target="_blank">Pain</a>, and <a href="https://gallery.manifold.xyz/0xa1c6f7c4cddecaed2f62164a36e1b32b9e5e5984/17" target="_blank">Conscious Crucifixion</a> play with contradictory themes of beauty and pain - an illustration of moments in my life that two polarities were intermingled.</p>
                <p>At the end of this album I have new insight on what ‘enlightenment’ could truly mean to me. A new analogy is necessary for the next chapter, but the 7 years I spent on that cosmic tight rope were very fruitful.</p>
                <p>To me, the journey of moving on to whatever is next is also what it means to be “trying to live life at, HYPERSPEEED.”</p>

                <h2>The Inadequacies of Current Algorithmic Art Dealers</h2>
                <p>A flash of inspiration manifests a fuzzy picture in my minds eye. The Zora State of Mind image & Pepe the frog - my ego tells my intuition it’s going to accept the muse’s contract. I’ve got to workout first though, and there’s new drama with the Friendsie rug finally confirmed.</p>
                <p>HYPERSPEEED onchain & new creative space to play with, I’ve returned to v4 Midjourney with new tactics & ideas. <a href="https://twitter.com/0xlght/status/1627139035876544514?s=20" target="_blank">Hyperpop</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/0xlght/status/1626866783528357889?s=20" target="_blank">Enlghtenment</a>, & now Algo Art Dealers. </p>
                <img src="Images/algo-art-dealers.png">
                <p>Earlier that evening I completed my ‘muse contract’ on <a href="https://zora.co/collections/0xc593e132c02c2354b423aae5dcd732fb206d2cc1" target="_blank">MEMEWARE</a>. Like most contracts I just shut up and get to work. The message is usually easier to understand in hindsight I’ve learned.</p>
                <p>And in some instances, with this being one of them, a bonus contract from the muse pops up after finishing the initial one. Algo Art Dealers is that bonus piece. One that provides multiple avenues of investigation.</p>
                <p>To understand what “memeware” means to me, is to understand what software is. It is also understanding what memes are, why we use story, & the power of words (internally and collectively).</p>
                <p>Assuming all that is common knowledge to the reader, Algo Art Dealers builds off of some of those foundations. It also dabbles in the conceptual reality of tech-x-culture (culture influenced by tech, not technology culture).</p>
                <h3>The Art</h3>
                <p>Initially the core idea was that we build something using robots, art dealing aesthetics (Sotheby’s), and add in some abstraction for necessary flavor - beyond that it’s an informalism approach. </p>
                <p>In hindsight, I see my curiosity/confusion in the current art world at the meta & anecdotal level starting to crystallize finally. Daily involvement in a new art world has left me with many questions. Here’s one:</p>
                <p>Do you think more people would know of Beeple or Monet? Well I ran a poll ↓</p>
                <div class="tweet-container">
                    <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">18-45 yr olds recognize which artist more you think??</p>&mdash; LGHT (@0xlght) <a href="https://twitter.com/0xlght/status/1628287668475035648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
                </div>
                <p>My hunch is that more people would know Beeple at the moment as well. The core instinct coming from the realization that most people (that consume art) are on social media platforms & have likely been fed a Beeple piece in their algorithms at some point. </p>
                <p>Is Monet in the algorithm at scale?? I think not, and this is the lead of my core instinct.</p>
                <h3>The Meta</h3>
                <p>Within the piece we have three text bubbles that signify the ‘bridges’ connecting what I’m thinking to the viewer. <strong>Trauma, Outrage, For you</strong>. In my estimation, these memes are the ‘gatekeepers’ of the current art world (via social media algorithmic search and discovery).</p>
                <p>It should be acknowledged that social media algorithms helped solve the previous ‘gatekeeper’ dilemma (auction houses, galleries, 1% access, etc). However, this does not absolve it of creating new gatekeepers in the form of conceptual ‘stratafigures’ - tangible code multiplied by intangible human intervention at scale. A wordy, but intentionally descriptive, way of saying we now face Algorithim Art Dealers instead of human ones. The things that push the ‘right’ button on a code set are now the keys to ‘access’ instead of pushing the ‘right’ button on humans.</p>
                <p>This is not inherently good or bad, yet the current apex of these new AI art dealers (Twitter) is not at all tuned for the art world ironically enough.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Trauma earns attention but is about personal and collective disaster</li>
                        <li>Outrage earns recognition but is about irrationalism and extremism</li>
                        <li>For You is a suggestive feed about what the algo values not the industry</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>If the keys to get past gatekeepers are unrelated, and even inhibitory, to the industry in question (decentralized art) it seems obvious that ‘unplanned’ obsolescence is in the cards. And on a more emotional side of things, it could be argued that it is harming individual expression at scale and the compounding effects of its potential success. A problem that is much too great for one individual to solve.</p>
                <h2>The Wrap Up</h2>
                <p>So, I am at the point of my contract where I have expressed what was needed from me. The art piece is a visual expression of this essay. This essay is an intellectual expression of the art piece. I have no claims on knowing the answer to this algo art dealer obstacles, but I have brought forth whatever it was the muse desired from me.</p>
                <p>If things remain unchanged then I believe Twitter will no longer be the home of onchain tech, art, and decentralized culture.</p>
                <p>Smells like an opportunity.</p>

                <h2>Just Mint It</h2>
                <p>By 2030 let’s assume that we were successful in onboarding most normies to blockchain culture. Everyone’s got their favorite non fungies & digital art is in a full swing renaissance.</p>
                <p>XCOPY’s work is priced in the stratosphere. All the people from 2020-2022 are household names. Let’s do a thought experiment.</p>
                <h3>Minter A</h3>
                <p>Highly selective with their mints back then. Overly stressed about ‘scarcity’ & ‘curating’ a collector base. They minted around 50 total pieces in those years. The ‘grail years’.</p>
                <h3>Minter B</h3>
                <p>Highly experimental with their mints back then. Not too concerned with ‘scarcity’ or even upholding a ‘quality standard’ for their collectors. They minted around 300 total pieces in those years. The ‘grail years’.</p>
                <h4>There are a couple questions here.</h4>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Who is likely to have better S&D dynamics</li>
                        <li>Who is likely to have a bigger collector base</li>
                        <li>Who is likely to have their work meme’d</li>
                        <li>Who is likely to be more relevant in history</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>Depending on what you are trying to accomplish you will choose A or B. I don’t really have a horse in your race so no need to get dogmatic.</p>
                <p>This thought experiment is for the artists that want to mint more. The ones that want to tag the blockchain with their signature while it’s still naked, but maybe they’re insecure about it.</p>
                <p>Artists are fickle. Many of them do what they are told in all areas of their life outside of creativity time. They mint when told. The collect when told. They get on their soap box when told. It’s human nature to a certain degree and I don’t fault them for it. I do take up arms when they start controlling the narrative however.</p>
                <img src="Images/meme.png">
                <p>If you want to mint it… mint it. If it doesn’t sell now maybe it will tomorrow, or next year, or 2030, or never - does it really matter?</p>
                <p>My prediction is by 2030 the years 2020-2022 will be revered in the manner 2017-2018 are right now. The work of artists that stuck around and kept building will be considered ‘grails’. And I genuinely believe the artists that only minted a handful of work, but still are around, will look somewhat silly for not maximizing the opportunity to put art in the rafters of blockchain history.</p>
                <p>Just my opinion though.</p>
